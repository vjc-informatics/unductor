# unductor
A 2WD robot that can communicate and respond in natural language.

To prep the RPi for use with the Watson API, you need to install NodeJS and some
libraries. There's a bootstrap shell script for you to do it. 

Communication with the Arduino will be done through a USB serial connection.
